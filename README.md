# Rust Projects

This repository contains several (maybe) unrelated projects that are supporting my learning journey for Rust.
Current projects are:

* [perfect-maze-generator](perfect-maze-generator/README.md): A console based perfect maze generator. A perfect maze 
allows only a single path between any two points, guaranteeing that following a wall should allow an agent to move
through the complete area.
* [Conway's Game of Life](conway-life/README.md): A simple cellular automata following Conway's rules.
