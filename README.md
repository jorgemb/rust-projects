# Rust Projects

This repository contains several (maybe) unrelated projects that are supporting my learning journey for Rust.
Current projects are:

* [perfect-maze-generator](perfect-maze-generator/README.md): A console based perfect maze generator. A perfect maze 
allows only a single path between any two points, guaranteeing that following a wall should allow an agent to move
through the complete area.
* [Conway's Game of Life](conway-life/README.md): A simple cellular automata following Conway's Game of Life rules.
Includes an example text based user interface to show the simulation in the command line.

## Future projects and ideas
Some projects that could be interesting to pursue are:

- [Elevator algorithm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/more-project-ideas-to-improve-your-coding-skills-99f48d09bb4b/):
It would involve both simulating a n-elevator environment with k-floors where random requests are given on different
floors. 
- Portfolio project: A place where all the rest of the projects in this repo can be visualized and reviewed.
- [Note-taking app](https://medium.com/geekculture/28-project-ideas-to-practice-your-programming-skills-d27eaa3d8ada):
A centralized place to take notes, search, review and otherwise organize notes.
- Chat application: A text-based chat application with support for several users.
